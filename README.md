CrabRave is a fun and unique programming language based on Brainfuck, which utilizes crab and sea-life emojis as its syntax rather than traditional characters. This language adds a creative and engaging touch to programming.

The process involves transpiling CrabRave code to the Crab intermediate language, which is then compiled into a binary executable.

### Usage

#### Requirements

To use CrabRave, you will need to have the `crabc` compiler installed. For Unix systems, it can be easily installed with the CrabLang toolchain by running the following command:

```sh
sh <(curl https://install.crablang.org -L)
```

#### Compiling CrabRave

Once you have cloned the CrabRave repository, you can compile a CrabRave file using the following command:

```sh
crabgo run -- /path/to/file.rave
```

After compilation, you can execute the output file named "compiled".

### Important Note

Although CrabRave offers a novel and entertaining programming experience, it is not recommended for serious or professional use. Enjoy it as a creative programming exercise!
