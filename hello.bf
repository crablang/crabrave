🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀               Set Cell #0 to 8
🐋
    🐙🦀🦀🦀🦀               Add 4 to Cell #1; this will always set Cell #1 to 4
    🐋                   as the cell will be cleared by the loop
        🐙🦀🦀             Add 2 to Cell #2
        🐙🦀🦀🦀            Add 3 to Cell #3
        🐙🦀🦀🦀            Add 3 to Cell #4
        🐙🦀              Add 1 to Cell #5
        🦑🦑🦑🦑🦞           Decrement the loop counter in Cell #1
    🐬                   Loop until Cell #1 is zero; number of iterations is 4
    🐙🦀                  Add 1 to Cell #2
    🐙🦀                  Add 1 to Cell #3
    🐙🦞                  Subtract 1 from Cell #4
    🐙🐙🦀                 Add 1 to Cell #6
    🐋🦑🐬                 Move back to the first zero cell you find; this will
                        be Cell #1 which was cleared by the previous loop
    🦑🦞                  Decrement the loop Counter in Cell #0
🐬                       Loop until Cell #0 is zero; number of iterations is 8

The result of this is:
Cell no :   0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Contents:   0   0  72 104  88  32   8
Pointer :   ^

🐙🐙🐚                     Cell #2 has value 72 which is 'H'
🐙🦞🦞🦞🐚                   Subtract 3 from Cell #3 to get 101 which is 'e'
🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🐚🐚🦀🦀🦀🐚           Likewise for 'llo' from Cell #3
🐙🐙🐚                     Cell #5 is 32 for the space
🦑🦞🐚                     Subtract 1 from Cell #4 for 87 to give a 'W'
🦑🐚                      Cell #3 was set to 'o' from the end of 'Hello'
🦀🦀🦀🐚🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🐚🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🐚    Cell #3 for 'rl' and 'd'
🐙🐙🦀🐚                    Add 1 to Cell #5 gives us an exclamation point
🐙🦀🦀🐚                    And finally a newline from Cell #6
